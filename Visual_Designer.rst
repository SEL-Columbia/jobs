We are looking for a visual/interaction designer to join our Lab (Modi Research Group at the Earth Institute, Columbia University).   We make software to make development process smarter and to bring new services (health and energy) to people that need them most (primary focus on Africa and India).

The tools we build incorporate geospatial planning, open-data webservices, mobile phone-based data collection and service delivery, and management dashboards used by governments.  We are primarily a Javascript and Python shop but looking primarily for people with a good design sense and experience in visual / interaction design, along with desire to tackle challenging global problems with code and design. Your particular role will be focused around designing clean and easy-to-use mobile and web interfaces using both graphic design tools and code; your outputs will be wireframes, mockups, and ultimately beautiful HTML5 pages. You should also be familiar with usability testing.

You will get to work with a dynamic team in New York, and travel to field sites in Africa and India to develop and implement solutions with clients on the ground.   This is critical to our process as we do agile development heavily based on iterative user feedback.

Some projects weâ€™re currently engaged on include:

 - formhub.org - A mobile data collection community that is opening up the tools of data collection rapidly. (http://formhub.org)
 - SharedSolar.org -  A pre-paid solar energy solution being deployed in rural Africa (http://sharedsolar.org)
 - Assisting the government of Nigeria to map all their clinics, schools and waterpoints (30,000+ and counting!)
 - ChildCount.org - An SMS based approach for improving child and maternal health
 - Network Planner - Spatial planning software used for infrastructure (electrification) planning.  Currently, being used by countries across Africa. Facility-based version viewable at http://spatialplanner.org
