We are looking for Software Engineer to join us at the Nairobi ModiLabs at the Columbia Global Center | Africa.

We build software to make development process smarter and to bring new services (health and energy) to people that need them most (primary focus on Africa, India and Haiti). We work directly with governments, non-profit organizations, and other institutions in the developing world, and help solve real-world problems with software. The problems we tackle are often related to data and data flow; the tools we build incorporate geospatial planning, open-data webservices, operational optimization algorithms, mobile phone-based data collection, data dashboards, and the like.  We are primarily a Python and Javascript shop but looking for people with a passion for software engineering above all.

If that excites you, send an email to mlberg AT gmail DOT com with a resume.
If you're the right person for the team, that matters more than even the position we are hiring for at the moment.

You will get to work with a dynamic team in Nairobi and  New York, and travel to field sites in Africa, Haiti and India to develop and implement solutions with clients on the ground. This is critical to our process as we do agile development heavily based on iterative user feedback.

Some projects weâ€™re currently engaged on include:
 - formhub - Mobile data collection made simple. (http://formhub.org)
 - bamboo - Dynamic data analysis. (http://bamboo.io)
 - SharedSolar.org -  A pre-paid solar energy solution being deployed in rural Africa (http://sharedsolar.org)
 - ChildCount.org - An SMS-based approach for improving child and maternal health (http://childcount.org)
 - Network Planner - Spatial planning software used for infrastructure (electrification) planning.  Used for large-scale planning in Ghana, Kenya, Senegal, Liberia and Indonesia. (http://networkplanner.modilabs.org)
