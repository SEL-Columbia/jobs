*Software Engineer*

We are looking for skilled and passionate Software Engineers to join our growing software engineering team in Nairobi.

As part of an extension lab of the The Modi Research Group at the Earth Institute (Columbia University), you would join a team of leading scientists and software engineers dedicated to building software tools that makes delivery of key services smarter and more efficient.

The tools we build incorporate geospatial planning, open-data webservices, mobile phone-based data collection and service delivery, and management dashboards used by governments.  We are primarily a Python shop but looking primarily for people with deep software engineering experience and desire to tackle challenging global problems with code.

You will get to work with a dynamic team both in Kenya and New York City. Some travel to project sites in Africa and India to engage directly with clients on the ground will be required.   This is critical to our process as we do agile development heavily based on iterative user feedback.

Some projects weâ€™re currently engaged on include:

 - SharedSolar.org -  A pre-paid solar energy solution being deployed in rural Africa (http://sharedsolar.org)
 - Assisting African governments do faciliy mapping (In Nigeria we are at 30,000+ clinics, schools and water points and counting!)
 - ChildCount.org - An SMS based approach for improving child and maternal health
 - formhub.org - a mobile data collection community
 - Network Planner - spatial planning software used for infrastructure (electrification) planning.  This was used to do Kenya's rural electrification planning and now is being used by numerous countries in Africa.

We are looking for skilled web engineers with a strong preference for people with strong Python, Javascript and Java (Android/J2ME) experience and a keen design sense highly.  Must be a team player.  

We are passionate about the importance of Open Source and would hope you feel the same way.
