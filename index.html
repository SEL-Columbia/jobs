<h1>We're Hiring!</h1>

<p>Join us at the <a href="http://sel.columbia.edu">Sustainable Engineering Lab</a> at the Earth Institute in Columbia University. </p>

<p>We solve real-world problems in the developing world; we build software to make development process smarter and to bring new services, like health and energy, to people that need them most. We primarily focus our efforts in Africa, India and Haiti.  </p>

<p>The problems we tackle are often related to data and data flow; the tools we build incorporate geospatial planning, open-data webservices, operational optimization algorithms, mobile phone-based data collection, data dashboards and the like.  We use python, R, go, mongodb, nodejs/javascript, but above all, we're looking for people who are passionate about software engineering in a development context.</p>

<p>You will get to work with a dynamic team in New York and travel to field sites in Africa, Haiti and India to develop and implement solutions with clients on the ground. This is critical to our process as we do agile development heavily based on iterative user feedback.</p>

<p><em>The right person for the team matters more than the description for any particular position. If that excites you, send an email to <a href="mailto:dp2704@columbia.edu">dp2704&#64;columbia.edu</a> with a resume. Columbia University is an affirmative action/equal opportunity employer. Minorities and women are encouraged to apply.</em></p>

<h2>Official openings:</h2>

<h4>Technical Project Manager</h4>

<p>What you will do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Oversee multi-disciplinary technical teams (infrastructure planning, data systems, software development) to ensure that tech solutions are in line with real-world project needs.</li>
<li>Collaborate with developing world partners and help define the technology / data systems to solve their problems.</li>
<li>Supervise software engineering and data analysis activities for multiple, separately-funded projects.</li>
<li>Write grant proposals for various funding agencies (World Bank, USAID, Gates, etc.)</li>
<li>Act as "translator" between field reality and the technical (software, data) team. Balance the two needs.</li>
<li>Play a major part in communicating the work of the Sustainable Engineering Lab, defining direction in the projects we work on.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will get to work with a great team: talented software engineers, data scientists and GIS analysts, as well as experienced International Dev experts in energy, water, and infrastructures. There is a lot to learn from this diverse team about both software and data, as well as about International Development.</p>

<h4>Embedded Systems / Electrical Engineer</h4>

<p>What you will do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lead the technical electrical design and prototyping of a smart-solar AC pumping system to be installed in Senegal. </li>
<li>Physically integrate hardware (PV, 3-phase inverters, pump controllers) and software components of the prototype system and carry out performance tests. Experience with power electronics will be essential.</li>
<li>Collaborate with our software developers to ensure that the system can work with our Android-based payment system.</li>
<li>Work in New York with a taleneted and diverse team, but with short-term field visits to the site in rural Senegal.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a unique opportunity to work on a USAID-funded innovation project to address the increasingly relevant water-energy nexus. More info about the project can be found on our blog (http://sel.columbia.edu/category/smart-solar-irrigation/).</p>

<h4>Software Engineer</h4>

<p>What you will do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Work with exciting projects in the developing world (example domains: mobile data collection, electricity planning, smart solar mini-grids, rural healthcare).</li>
<li>Design, create and improve open source software to solve hard problems in the developing world.</li>
<li>Join a like-minded peer group of hackers working in python, R, go, mongodb, nodejs and other interesting technologies, focused on making the world suck less. </li>
<li>Travel to developing world settings and work directly in the environments your software is deployed in.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are no sales/MBA types, no scrum masters, and we strongly disapprove of code written in <a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition">Enterprise FizzBuzz</a> style. You will work with great software engineers and data scientists, as well as experts who have been working in International Development contexts for many years.</p>
