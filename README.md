# We're Hiring!

Join us at the [Sustainable Engineering Lab](http://sel.columbia.edu/) at the [Earth Institute](http://earth.columbia.edu/) in [Columbia University](http://www.columbia.edu/). 

We build software to make development process smarter and to bring new services (health and energy) to people that need them most (primary focus on Africa, India and Haiti). 

We work directly with governments, non-profit organizations, and other institutions in the developing world, and help solve real-world problems with software. 

The problems we tackle are often related to data and data flow; the tools we build incorporate geospatial planning, open-data webservices, operational optimization algorithms, mobile phone-based data collection, data dashboards, and the like.  

We use python, R, go, mongodb, nodejs/javascript primarily, but looking for people with a passion for software engineering above all.

You will get to work with a dynamic team in New York, and travel to field sites in Africa, Haiti and India to develop and implement solutions with clients on the ground. This is critical to our process as we do agile development heavily based on iterative user feedback.

If that excites you, send an email to [dp2704&#64;columbia.edu](mailto:dp2704@columbia.edu) with a resume.

*If you're the right person for the team, that matters more than the description for any particular position.*

## Official openings:

####  Technical Project Manager 

What you will do:
 * Work directly with developing world partners and help define the technology / data systems to solve their problems.
 * Participate in some of the software engineering and data analysis as relevant.
 * Act as "translator" between field reality and the technical (software, data) domain. Balancing the two needs.
 * Play a major part in communicating the work of the Sustainable Engineering Lab, defining direction in the projects we work on.

You will get to work with a great team: talented software engineers, data scientists and GIS analysts, as well as experienced Int'l Dev experts in energy, water, and infrastructures. There is a lot to learn from this diverse team about both software and data, as well as about International Development.

#### Data Scientist / Analyst

What you will do:
 * Make sense of datasets relating to access to health, education, water and electricity in developing nations.
 * Develop data pipelines, data visualizations, analytical reports.
 * Participate in the monitoring of data collection processes, provide recommendations to improve it.
 * Interact directly with partners in developing nations to create data solutions to their needs.
 * Participate in training data teams at partner organizations, "transfer" your work.
 * Document your work excellently, make it reproducible, and write how-to articles when relevant

#### Software Engineer

What you will do:
 * Work with exciting projects in the developing world (example domains: mobile data collection, electricity planning, smart solar mini-grids, rural healthcare).
 * Design, create, and improve open source software to solve hard problems in the developing world.
 * Joining a like-minded peer group of hackers working in python, R, go, mongodb, nodejs, and other interesting technologies, focused on making the world suck less. 
 * Travel to developing world settings, and work directly in the environments your software is deployed in.

There are no sales/MBA types, no scrum masters, and we strongly disapprove of code written in [Enterprise FizzBuzz](https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition) style. You will work with great software engineers and data scientists, as well as experts who have been working in International Development contexts for many years.

## Projects

Have a look at [our site](http://sel.columbia.edu/) for some of the [projects](http://sel.columbia.edu/projects/) we are working on, and some [software tools](http://sel.columbia.edu/products-tools/) we are building to solve some of the problems we encounter.

Project examples:

 * Nigeria Scale-up Initiative - Taking the lessons of the Millennium Villages (http://www.millenniumvillages.org/) to scale in a partnership with Nigeria's Presidential taskforce on the Millennium Development goals. [See related blog posts](http://sel.columbia.edu/category/nigeria-scaleup/)
 * [Dristhi](http://sel.columbia.edu/dristhi/) - Mobile-based patient tracking for rural nurse midwives. 
 * [Solar Irrigation](http://sel.columbia.edu/projects) - Smart solar irrigation in Senegal.

Software examples:
 * [Formhub](http://formhub.org) - Mobile data collection made simple. 1000s of users, millions of surveys collected.
 * [Network Planner](http://networkplanner.modilabs.org) - Spatial planning software used for infrastructure (electrification) planning.  Used for large-scale planning in Ghana, Kenya, Senegal, Liberia and Indonesia.
 * [bamboo](http://bamboo.io) - Open Source Dynamic Data Analysis.
