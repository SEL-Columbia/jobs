A full time Software Engineer is needed to work on projects related to the Earth Institutes Millennium Villages project (see: http://www.millenniumvillages.org/), specifically scaling up the SharedSolar initiative (see: http://sharedsolar.org/). The Software Engineer will develop, optimize, document, test, and deploy a gateway software application related to distributed power systems as well as a visualization platform. The Software Engineer will also assume ownership of the creation, implementation and support of a platform to monitor, control and verify payments of consumer accounts on the SharedSolar power systems. End users will constitute investors, donors, operators and researchers. The created platform will interface with deployed metering systems via cellular companies' communication protocols, i.e. SMS, GPRS or WiFi enabled devices such as Android phones. The primary function of this position is to write efficient, robust, creative code that will comprise this software system. Development of these solutions will be done largely using the Python programming language and modern Web 2.0 methodologies  

Other tools we build incorporate geospatial planning, open-data webservices, mobile phone-based data collection and service delivery, and management dashboards used by governments.  We are primarily a Python shop but looking primarily for people with deep software engineering experience and desire to tackle challenging global problems with code.

You will get to work with a dynamic team in New York, and travel to field sites in Africa and India to develop and implement solutions with clients on the ground.   This is critical to our process as we do agile development heavily based on iterative user feedback.

Some projects weâ€™re currently engaged on include:

 - SharedSolar.org -  A pre-paid solar energy solution being deployed in rural Africa (http://sharedsolar.org)
 - Assisting the government of Nigeria to map all their clinics, schools and waterpoints (30,000+ and counting!)
 - ChildCount.org - An SMS based approach for improving child and maternal health
 - formhub.org - a mobile data collection community
 - Network Planner - spatial planning software used for infrastructure (electrification) planning.  Currently, being used by countries across Africa.
