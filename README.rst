We are looking for various positions to join us at the Modi Research Group at the Earth Institute in Columbia University. 
Current positions include:
 - Front-end Software Developer - https://github.com/modilabs/jobs/blob/master/Frontend_Software_Dev.rst
 - Software Developer - https://github.com/modilabs/jobs/blob/master/Software_Developer.rst
 - Visual / Interaction Designer - please email [pp2427@columbia.edu](mailto:pp247@columbia.edu) your resume directly.
 - Other Software Engineers with a passion for development - please email [pp2427@columbia.edu](mailto:pp2427@columbia.edu) your resume directly, and we'll chat.

We make software to make development process smarter and to bring new services (health and energy) to people that need them most (primary focus on Africa, India and Haiti).

The tools we build incorporate geospatial planning, open-data webservices, mobile phone-based data collection and service delivery, and management dashboards used by governments.  We are primarily a Python and Javascript shop but looking primarily for people with deep software engineering experience and desire to tackle challenging global problems with code.

You will get to work with a dynamic team in New York, and travel to field sites in Africa, Haiti and India to develop and implement solutions with clients on the ground. This is critical to our process as we do agile development heavily based on iterative user feedback.

Some projects weâ€™re currently engaged on include:
 - [formhub](http://formhub.org) - a mobile data collection community
 - SharedSolar.org -  A pre-paid solar energy solution being deployed in rural Africa (http://sharedsolar.org)
 - Assisting the government of Nigeria to map all their clinics, schools and waterpoints (30,000+ and counting!)
 - ChildCount.org - An SMS based approach for improving child and maternal health
 - Network Planner - spatial planning software used for infrastructure (electrification) planning.  Currently, being used by countries across Africa.
 - [Spatial Planner](http://spatialplanner.modilabs.org) - spatial planning software used for facility-based (think health facility) planning.
