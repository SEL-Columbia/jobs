We are looking for various positions to join us at the Modi Research Group at the Earth Institute in Columbia University. 

We make software to make development process smarter and to bring new services (health and energy) to people that need them most (primary focus on Africa, India and Haiti).

We work directly with governments, non-profit organizations, and other institutions in the developing world, and help solve real-world problems with software. The problems we tackle are mainly those of information flow optimization.  The tools we build incorporate geospatial planning, open-data webservices, mobile phone-based data collection and service delivery, data dashboards and the like.  We are primarily a Python and Javascript shop but looking for people with a passion for software engineering above all.

If that excites you, send an email to pp2427 AT columbia DOT edu with a resume.
If you're the right person for the team, that matters more than even the position we are hiring for at the moment.


Official openings at the moment:
 - Senior Software Engineer [1]_
 - Front-end Software Developer [2]_
 - Data Analyst (part-time) [3]_
 - Other Software Engineers with a passion for development - please email pp2427 AT columbia DOT edu your resume directly, and we'll chat.

You will get to work with a dynamic team in New York, and travel to field sites in Africa, Haiti and India to develop and implement solutions with clients on the ground. This is critical to our process as we do agile development heavily based on iterative user feedback.

Some projects weâ€™re currently engaged on include:
 - formhub - Mobile data collection made simple (http://formhub.org)
 - bamboo - Dynamic data analyssi (http://bamboo.io)
 - SharedSolar.org -  A pre-paid solar energy solution being deployed in rural Africa (http://sharedsolar.org)
 - ChildCount.org - An SMS based approach for improving child and maternal health
 - Network Planner - Spatial planning software used for infrastructure (electrification) planning.  Currently, being used by countries across Africa.
 - Spatial Planner  - Spatial planning software used for facility-based (think health facility) planning (http://spatialplanner.modilabs.org).


.. [1] You'll be working primarily on http://github.com/modilabs/bamboo, or where you think dynamic data analysis should be taken.
.. [2] Turns out displaying data in the right way matters a lot in developing country scarce-data situations. We want to work on an awesome client-side dashboard framework; apply RIGHT NOW if that sounds interesting. Lots of interesting front-end work all around, however.
.. [3] R coders will be welcome with open arms :)
