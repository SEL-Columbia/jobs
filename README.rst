We are looking for various positions to join us at the Modi Research Group at the Earth Institute in Columbia University. 

We build software to make development process smarter and to bring new services (health and energy) to people that need them most (primary focus on Africa, India and Haiti). We work directly with governments, non-profit organizations, and other institutions in the developing world, and help solve real-world problems with software. The problems we tackle are often related to data and data flow; the tools we build incorporate geospatial planning, open-data webservices, operational optimization algorithms, mobile phone-based data collection, data dashboards, and the like.  We are primarily a Python and Javascript shop but looking for people with a passion for software engineering above all.

If that excites you, send an email to pp2427 AT columbia DOT edu with a resume.
If you're the right person for the team, that matters more than even the position we are hiring for at the moment.

Official openings for May 2013:
 - Senior Software Engineer - [1]_
 - Front-end Software Developer - [2]_
 - Other Software Engineers with a passion for development - please email pp2427 AT columbia DOT edu your resume directly, and we'll chat.

You will get to work with a dynamic team in New York, and travel to field sites in Africa, Haiti and India to develop and implement solutions with clients on the ground. This is critical to our process as we do agile development heavily based on iterative user feedback.

Perks of working with the Modi Research Group:
 - Get to work on highly impactful problems in the developing world, such as helping rural nurse mid-wives keep track of patients in rural India.
 - Write open source code, and build open products for others to use, while making real-world impact.
 - Work with the same tools industry leaders are using. NoSQL databases, R, pandas, machine learning techniques, and other tools that today's data scientist and data engineers are talking about: we use them!
 - Work with a great (and diverse) team in New York, Kenya, Mali, and Denver.
 - Interact with professors, and maybe take classes at Columbia. 
 - Get to travel to interesting places for work!
