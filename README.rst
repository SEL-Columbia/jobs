Join us at the Sustainable Engineering Lab at the Earth Institute in Columbia University. 

We build software to make development process smarter and to bring new services (health and energy) to people that need them most (primary focus on Africa, India and Haiti). We work directly with governments, non-profit organizations, and other institutions in the developing world, and help solve real-world problems with software. The problems we tackle are often related to data and data flow; the tools we build incorporate geospatial planning, open-data webservices, operational optimization algorithms, mobile phone-based data collection, data dashboards, and the like.  We are primarily a Python and Javascript shop but looking for people with a passion for software engineering above all.

You will get to work with a dynamic team in New York, and travel to field sites in Africa, Haiti and India to develop and implement solutions with clients on the ground. This is critical to our process as we do agile development heavily based on iterative user feedback.
